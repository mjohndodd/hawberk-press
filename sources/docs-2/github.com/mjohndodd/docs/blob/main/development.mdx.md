title | Development
description | Preview changes locally to update your docs

\*\*Prerequisites\*\*: - Node.js version 19 or higher - A docs repository with a \`docs.json\` file

Follow these steps to install and run Mintlify on your operating system.

```shell
npm i -g mint
```

Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and run the following command:

```shell
mint dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Custom ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Mintlify on port 3333, use this command:

```shell
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```shell
npm mint update
```

## Validating links

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```shell
mint broken-links
```

## Deployment

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

## Code formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

```
This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`
```

```
Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Then run `mint dev` again.
```
